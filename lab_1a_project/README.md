In this project I built an "Angry birds pool game" for an FPGA controller. Worked with system-verilog HDL and Quartus Prime framework.
I put an emphasise on: organizing the code into different modules, as less code-duplication as possible and as much communication between me and my partner as 
possible.
During my work, I learned alot about HDL and how it is different from software programming languages that I was used to.
